FABRIC leadership team members Ilya Baldin and Inder Monga will speak on "Panel Discussion on Cyberinfrastructure Challenges & Opportunities for Facilities in the 21st Century and Approaches to Cyberinfrastructure & Data Management" as part of the Large Facilities October 2021 Webinar.

Cyberinfrastructure (CI), comprising computing, data, software, and networking and related expertise are critical components of most NSF major facilities and essential to their operations, equitable use, and overall impact. Architecting, deploying and operating a robust, secure, performant and scalable CI can be challenging, especially considering new security challenges/ threats, new and changing science needs, and rapidly evolving (and often disruptive) technology landscapes. Furthermore, emerging technologies can enable novel approaches for operating and using facilities. This session will include a panel and audience discussion on these CI challenges and opportunities for NSF facilities in the 21st century. The discussions will explore existing best practices, approaches for developing shared (and sustainable) CI services and for leveraging national CI services, as well as opportunities for transforming facilities’ science through CI innovations.
