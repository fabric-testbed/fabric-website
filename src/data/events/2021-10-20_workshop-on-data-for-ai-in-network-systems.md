  title: Workshop on Data for AI in Network Systems
  description: In a future world where AI is pervasively deployed across networks and applications the society depends on, having a good understanding of the data that will be shaping them and subsequently shaping us is timely and critical. What data will be made available for AI network systems? How will they be collected and used? What properties of such data, and in what ways, would they impact the networks and applications in technical, legal, and ethical contexts? And, most importantly, how will the mindsets of AI researchers, developers, and our next generation of students evolve and transform as we head into the future?

In a future world where AI is pervasively deployed across networks and applications the society depends on, having a good understanding of the data that will be shaping them and subsequently shaping us is timely and critical. What data will be made available for AI network systems? How will they be collected and used? What properties of such data, and in what ways, would they impact the networks and applications in technical, legal, and ethical contexts? And, most importantly, how will the mindsets of AI researchers, developers, and our next generation of students evolve and transform as we head into the future?

In order to answer these questions, FABRIC leadership team members Anita Nikolich and Kuang-Ching Wang, along with IT experts Ron Hutchins and Tho Nyguyen, have announced the Workshop on Data for AI in Network Systems, which will be held virtually from <b>October 20 - 21</b>. The event is funded by NSF and hosted by RENCI. To be invited to the workshop, interested parties must submit a 1-2 page whitepaper for consideration. The submission deadline for whitepapers is <b>September 18, 2021</b>.
