The FABRIC team is proud to share its [newest testbed release](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/forums/topic/fabric-is-now-open-with-even-more-sites-and-features/). The team has added many new production sites and has introduced the FABlib library; both of which increase the capabilities and usability of the testbed.

The FABRIC community is cordially invited to participate in an upcoming FABRIC tutorial webinar, hosted by Paul Ruth. The purpose of this webinar is to introduce incoming and existing beta users to the new features and onboard new teams to the testbed. The FABlib library is significantly different from the original FABRIC API and this webinar will be valuable to both new and experienced users. During this webinar, Ruth will present new features and walkthrough several FABlib example experiments.

The webinar will take place from 12 - 2 PM ET, and space will be limited. Please indicate all dates that you are available on the form linked to this event, and the team will be in touch with your confirmed webinar date.
