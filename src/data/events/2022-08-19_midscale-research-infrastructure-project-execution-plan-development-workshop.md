This workshop will prepare social and behavioral science, education, and computer science researchers for the submission of a NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure proposal. The workshop focuses specifically on development of the Project Execution Plan (PEP), which guides the project management for such a project. Workshop participants will gain an understanding of what a PEP is, what PEP requirements are for NSF Midscale proposals and how to develop an effective PEP for their project.

FABRIC leadership team member Ilya Baldin will present a talk at the event.
