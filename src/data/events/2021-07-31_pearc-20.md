PEARC20's theme is "Catch the Wave." This year's theme embodies the spirit of the community's drive to stay on pace and in front of all the new waves in technology, analytics, and a globally connected and diverse workforce.

FABRIC will run a 90-minute panel that will present ways in which the emerging FABRIC testbed &mdash; which offers programmable compute and storage capabilities in the core of the network &mdash; can be used to develop and experiment with completely new types of HPC-related applications and services. We will also elicit feedback and questions from attendees regarding the types of services and capabilities that would help advance their research.
