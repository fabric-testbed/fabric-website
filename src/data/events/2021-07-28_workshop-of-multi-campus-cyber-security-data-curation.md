  title: "Workshop: Multi-Campus Cyber-Security Data Curation for Research and Education"
  description: FABRIC leadership team member Anita Nikolich serve as a panelist for the “Towards Building a Community Data Infrastructure for Cybersecurity Research” panel. The goal of the workshop is to engage the community to formulate a vision and roadmap for the creation of a multi-campus data collection and sharing infrastructure for use by machine-learning cybersecurity and privacy researchers. Such a federated infrastructure will be invaluable for detecting zero-day (new, previously unseen) attacks and large-scale attacks with complex kill-chains, e.g., the Wannacry ransomware attack, Mirai Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. Discussion will encompass legal, ethical, privacy, organizational and sustainability considerations.
