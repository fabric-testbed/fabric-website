MERIF, the Midscale Experimental Research Infrastructure Forum, is an NSF-CISE-funded project, one of whose goals is to look beyond todayâ€™s midscale research infrastructure projects for visions of future infrastructures that can support experiments at the frontiers of CISE research areas, both within computer science itself and interdisciplinary.

Key features of these infrastructures are their ability to support multiple experiments, to enable a high degree of documented experimental reproducibility, to provide rapid recoverability for the next experiment and overall to support high quality research at the frontier of their respective research areas.

FABRIC leadership team members Ilya Baldin and KC Wang will present a session on Data: Archiving, Curation, and Management at 12:30 PM ET on June 2.
