Hosted by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Accelerator, this exciting virtual exhibition event is your chance to check out novel solutions across six convergence research topics addressing national-scale societal challenges.

During the event you will have the opportunity to connect with NSF-funded Convergence Accelerator research teams including viewing live presentations and solution demos. You may also network with other researchers, innovators, and business and technical practitioners from academia, industry, government, nonprofit, and other communities of practice.

Key features of these infrastructures are their ability to support multiple experiments, to enable a high degree of documented experimental reproducibility, to provide rapid recoverability for the next experiment and overall to support high quality research at the frontier of their respective research areas.

FABRIC leadership team member Anita Nikolich will pitch a project at the event.
