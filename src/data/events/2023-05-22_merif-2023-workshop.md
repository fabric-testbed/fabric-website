MERIF, the Midscale Experimental Research Infrastructure Forum, brings together NSF-related research infrastructure providers and users to share experiences and improve science infrastructure. Midscale experimental research infrastructures are those funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the $5M to $20M range. Each midscale typically attracts hundreds of researchers or more from across academia, industry, and government.

The goal of the workshop is to encourage collaborations among midscales, researchers, students, and industry with an emphasis on research productivity, reproducibility, and inclusion. The workshop will expose (potential) research users to the various midscale platforms and encourage cross-platform activities and innovative new research.

The FABRIC leadership team will present a talk / demo on FABRIC during the event.
