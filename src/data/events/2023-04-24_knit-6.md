KNIT 6, the second in-person FABRIC Community Workshop, will take place from April 24 - 26, 2023 in Austin, TX. KNIT 6 will be hosted by the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

FABRIC, an international infrastructure that enables cutting-edge experimentation and research at-scale, is up and running. The FABRIC team is excited to share updates from the platform, experimenters, and wider community.

We'll kick off the workshop on April 24 with small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics. From April 25-26, the FABRIC team will provide new project highlights and present demos on the platform. Experimenters across multiple science domains will present compelling experiments and solicit feedback from fellow participants during “unconference sessions.” The team will expand on how FABRIC can support researchers across areas such as networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage, virtual reality, 5G, machine learning, and science applications. Attendees will get the chance to explore the FABRIC portal, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.
