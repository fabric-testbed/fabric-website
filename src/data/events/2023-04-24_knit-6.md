KNIT 6, the second in-person FABRIC Community Workshop, will take place from April 24 - 26, 2023 in Austin, TX. KNIT 6 will be hosted by the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/).

FABRIC, an international infrastructure that enables cutting-edge experimentation and research at-scale, is up and running. The FABRIC team is excited to share updates from the platform, experimenters, and wider community.

We'll kick off the workshop on April 24 with small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics. From April 25-26, the FABRIC team will provide new project highlights and present demos on the platform. Experimenters across multiple science domains will present compelling experiments and solicit feedback from fellow participants during “unconference sessions.” The team will expand on how FABRIC can support researchers across areas such as networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage, virtual reality, 5G, machine learning, and science applications. Attendees will get the chance to explore the FABRIC portal, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.

### In-Person Registration

Our team is excited to bring the FABRIC Community together for the first time in 2023. Hosting KNIT 6 in-person gives us the opportunity to offer small group beginner and advanced topics tutorials, one-on-one time to provide coaching and advice from FABRIC leadership, and a reception where experimenters will present demos and posters. If you’re planning to become an early user of FABRIC and utilize the platform to experiment in the near future, we highly encourage you to attend.

The [registration form](http://apps2.research.unc.edu/events/index.cfm?event=events.go&key=B95C) allows you to choose the sessions you are interested in attending, indicate your interest in applying for a student travel grant, and/or receive special pricing as an in-person attendee of our KNIT 5 event in September 2022.

We are working on measures to ensure the safety of all in-person participants and will share additional details in the coming weeks.

### Streaming Pass

However, we understand that not everyone can join us, due to company travel restrictions, health concerns, or other reasons. For these members of our community, we are delighted to offer a KNIT 6 STREAMING PASS. The Streaming Pass offers attendees limited access to the virtual aspects of the KNIT 6 Workshop.

The Streaming Pass will be available for purchase for events taking place April 25 - 26; the Streaming Pass is not available for the April 24 hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions, advanced training topics, FABRIC facility partner TACC tour or the FABRIC evening demo on April 25.
