KNIT 6, the second in-person FABRIC Community Workshop, which will take place from April 24 - 26, 2023 in Austin, TX. KNIT 6 will be hosted by the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/).

FABRIC, an international infrastructure that enables cutting-edge experimentation and research at-scale, is up and running. The FABRIC team is excited to share updates from the platform, experimenters, and wider community.

We'll kick off the workshop on April 24 with small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics. From April 25-26, the FABRIC team will provide new project highlights and present demos on the platform. Experimenters across multiple science domains will present compelling experiments and solicit feedback from fellow participants during “unconference sessions.” The team will expand on how FABRIC can support researchers across areas such as networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage, virtual reality, 5G, machine learning, and science applications. Attendees will get the chance to explore the FABRIC portal, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.

**_What is an “unconference?”_**

Unconference is participant-driven sessions. There are no scheduled topics or speakers prior to the start of the workshop. On the morning of Tuesday, April 25, workshop attendees will gather to hear the proposed topics and vote on what interests them most. As a group, it will be decided what topics will be presented during the afternoon sessions and for how long. If you are interested in leading an unconference session, please indicate your interest on the registration form or email your topic and a brief abstract to Savannah ([sjamieson@renci.org](mailto:sjamieson@renci.org)).

**_What is a "demo night?”_**

During the Demo Night, FABRIC users will be stationed throughout the room ready to show you their experiments. Come socialize & see what users are doing on FABRIC!

### In-Person Registration

Our team is excited to bring the FABRIC Community together for the first time in 2023. Hosting KNIT 6 in-person gives us the opportunity to offer small group beginner and advanced topics tutorials, one-on-one time to provide coaching and advice from FABRIC leadership, and a reception where experimenters will present demos and posters. If you’re planning to become an early user of FABRIC and utilize the platform to experiment in the near future, we highly encourage you to attend.

The [registration form](http://apps2.research.unc.edu/events/index.cfm?event=events.go&key=B95C) allows you to choose the sessions you are interested in attending and/or receive special pricing as an in-person attendee of our KNIT 5 event in September 2022.

We are working on measures to ensure the safety of all in-person participants and will share additional details in the coming weeks.

**The last day to register for in-person attendance is April 14.**
