The Internet2 Technology Exchange is the premier technical event in the global research and education (R&E) community. The event brings together a community of technical visionaries – a group that includes the most inventive chief technologists, scientists, engineers, architects, operators, and students – in a forum for debate, discussion, and the conversations critical to ensuring that global technology leaders are aligned and moving forward together. FABRIC leadership team members will be present at the event and will host a tutorial on using the platform.
