FABRIC leadership team member Anita Nikolich will attend a workshop hosted by USC ISI's workshop, which will focus on discussion of obstacles in cybersecurity experimentation, what is needed to overcome them (e.g., more diverse hardware, labeled datasets, reusable experiments, etc.), and how to improve repeatability and reuse of cybersecurity artifacts.
