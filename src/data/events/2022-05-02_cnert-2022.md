  title: The 9th International Workshop on Computer and Networking Experimental Research using Testbeds (CNERT 2022)
  description: "Experimentation has played an important role in advancing research in computing and networking. Although theory and simulation are important tools for studying and analyzing the behavior of new protocols and algorithms, it is essential that new research ideas be validated on real systems, testbeds, and infrastructure that provides a platform for exploring new systems."

Experimentation has played an important role in advancing research in computing and networking. Although theory and simulation are important tools for studying and analyzing the behavior of new protocols and algorithms, it is essential that new research ideas be validated on real systems, testbeds, and infrastructure that provides
a platform for exploring new systems.

This workshop brings together researchers and technical experts to share experiences and advance the state-of-the-art in experimental research in areas such as networking, distributed systems, and cloud computing. It aims to inspire researchers to use testbeds in novel and interesting ways as a means to validate research ideas. FABRIC leadership team member Anita Nikolich is one of the co-chairs this year.

Of particular interest are experiments on publicly available testbeds such as the CENI, Chameleon, CloudLab, DeterLab, Emulab, FABRIC, the Fed4FIRE+ testbeds, FIT, OneLab, ORBIT, the PAWR project testbeds (COSMOS, POWDER-RENEW, AERPAW), among many others worldwide.
