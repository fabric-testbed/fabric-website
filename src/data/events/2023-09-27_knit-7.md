KNIT 7, the third in-person FABRIC Community Workshop, will take place from September 27-29, 2023 in Columbus, OH. KNIT 7 will be hosted by [The Quilt](https://www.thequilt.net/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9011SoTrefUWVbeZyBo93Ze7IGm-tT2aM59X-ImmPRKwVtmuxi6GZQDg0AUfvJVxEmThui) and co-located with the [NSF CC* PI Workshop](https://www.thequilt.net/public-event/the-2023-quilt-fall-member-meeting-nsf-cc-pi-workshop-oarnet-35th-anniversary-and-fabric-co-located-meeting/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9011SoTrefUWVbeZyBo93Ze7IGm-tT2aM59X-ImmPRKwVtmuxi6GZQDg0AUfvJVxEmThui). It will be the last workshop before FABRIC enters full operations.

We'll kick off the workshop on September 27 with small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics. From September 28-29,  experimenters across multiple science domains will highlight their use of FABRIC to push forward compelling experiments. The FABRIC team will set the stage for the future of FABRIC and solicit feedback from fellow participants during talks, open mic sessions, and the demo night. Additionally, attendees will have the chance to hear unique plenary discussions, including a panel featuring NSF officers. Attendees will get the chance to explore what FABRIC has to offer, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.

**The last day to [register for in-person attendance](https://events.thequilt.net/event/fabric-knit7/) is September 11.**
