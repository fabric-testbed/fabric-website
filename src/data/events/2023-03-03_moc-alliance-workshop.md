Registration is open for the 2023 MOC Alliance Workshop. The workshop will bring together a unique community of Research IT, researchers, users, and industry to celebrate what has been accomplished and help define the MOC Alliance strategy moving forward. In addition, it will showcase how the Alliance is so much more than the sum of its parts. Sessions will cover research that was motivated by experience with a real cloud, the impact research has already had on upstream open source projects, and how some of these projects are starting to impact services that are part of the Alliance.

FABRIC leadership will be present at the 2023 MOC Alliance Workshop.
