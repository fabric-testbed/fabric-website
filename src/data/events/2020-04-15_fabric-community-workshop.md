On April 15-16th 2020 FABRIC will host a Community Visioning Workshop at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for academic researchers, industry, technologists, R&E network and computing facilities operators, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas and provide feedback on the proposed architecture and scope of the FABRIC project.

#### White paper assignment

Pick an idea/topic regarding testbeds and experimentation and submit a 1-2 pager on it. We'd especially like to foster discussion such as:

- Feedback on the FABRIC architecture and thoughts about its use?
- Beyond the 4 initial science drivers (IoT, Security, Machine Learning, NDN), what other research areas have unique networking requirements? What other research communities and opportunities can we engage as early design partners?
- Should experimental data be shared between experimenters and how?
- What were any important deficiencies in existing testbeds that made you not use them? How can FABRIC change your mind about testbed benefits?
- Opportunities for global experimentation leveraging FABRIC?
- What advanced network measurement functions would you like to see, including timing precision functions?
- Opportunities for innovative education, in and beyond classrooms, leveraging FABRIC
