We are delighted to announce the dates for the first-ever in-person FABRIC Community Workshop, which will take place from September 20-22, 2022 in Chicago, IL. KNIT 5 will be hosted by Northwestern University.

FABRIC, an international infrastructure that enables cutting-edge experimentation and research at-scale, is up and running. The FABRIC team is excited to share updates from the platform, experimenters, and wider community.

We'll kick off the workshop on September 20 with small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics, a tour of FABRIC facility partner STARLIGHT, and a reception event. From September 21-22, the FABRIC team will provide new project highlights, present demos on the platform, and discuss increased capabilities through integration with testbeds such as Chameleon, PAWR, and CloudLab. Early experimenters across multiple science domains will present compelling experiments and share how FABRIC can support researchers across areas such as networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage, virtual reality, 5G, machine learning, and science applications. Attendees will get the chance to explore the FABRIC portal, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.

Space will be limited. If you are interested in applying for a travel stipend, [please review these guidelines.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clrVMAJsQ01PrsAG3d2I1n0b_P2seD4XmeTugRoji34/edit?usp=sharing) Preference will be given to individuals who have paid for their registration in advance.

We urge you to register as soon as possible if you would like to attend, as space will be limited. Our team is working on measures to ensure the safety of all in-person participants and will share additional details in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you there!
