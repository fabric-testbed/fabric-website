question: How will experimenters interact with FABRIC? 
---
A FABRIC Portal will provide basic browser-based access to FABRIC resources. Programmatic access will be provided with help of FABRIC client libraries that can be operated as a CLI or embedded into experimenter code. Initially Python bindings will be provided which later may be extended to other languages. FABRIC will provide a hosted Jupyter Hub environment for experimenters, which will come with Jupter notebooks automatically preloaded with FABRIC libraries and CLI tools. 
The portal and Jupyter Hub will use federated identity through CI Logon and support any institutional identity provider that is part of InCommon R&S (Research and Scholarship) federation. This includes the majority of US educational institutions.
