question: How will FABRIC resources be allocated to experimenters? 
---
Initial FABRIC experiments during the construction phase (2019-2023) will be done through individual agreements between specific researchers identified as early experimenters, and the FABRIC team. When FABRIC enters production it will have an AUP and an allocation policy that balances the needs of various experimenter groups (long-running and resource-intensive) and educational uses. Mechanisms will be put in place to enforce those allocation policies across the FABRIC footprint and will provide flexibility for FABRIC expansion site owners and Facility Partners to allow them to enforce site-specific allocation policies.
