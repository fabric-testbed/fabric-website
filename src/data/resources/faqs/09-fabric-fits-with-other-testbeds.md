question: How does FABRIC fit in with other shared experimental infrastructures (NSF Clouds, PRP/NRP, PAWR testbeds)?
---
FABRIC is not meant to be an isolated testbed facility, rather it aims to interconnect many other experimental and production facilities to create a rich substrate for experimentation, which allows experimenters to pick and choose portions of the infrastructure for their experiment. We are interested in ideas for early experiments that combine the capabilities of these facilities together, please reach out to us at info@fabric-testbed.net. 
FABRIC team will work with organizations running these other facilities in order to enable joint experiments through network connectivity, joint tooling, identity federation and other mechanisms that reduce the friction of creating cross-facility/cross-testbed experiments.
