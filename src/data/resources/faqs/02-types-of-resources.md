question: What types of resources will FABRIC provide and how will they be allocated and accessed?
---
FABRIC will allow experimenters to instantiate compute instances in the form of bare-metal servers, VMs and containers with significant compute and storage capabilities as well as directly attached PCI devices: multi-port SmartNICs, GPUs and FPGAs. These compute instances will be interconnected with on-demand high-bandwidth links up to 25-100Gbps in the Core and higher bit rates in the SuperCore portion of the topology. These compute instances can also have storage in the form of dedicated NVMe drives and slower, but larger dynamically partitionable block storage. Several sites will provide on-demand access to 100Gbps P4-capable switches, which can similarly be linked into experimenter topologies. Compute instances will be accessible by experimenters via SSH, other more scalable experiment control tools may be contributed by the community later.
FABRIC will offer different network services: a best-effort Layer 2/IPv6 network matching FABRIC footprint, on-demand Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies and peering between slice topologies and production networks. Public cloud peering at 100Gbps in two bi-coastal locations will be offered through a partnership with Internet2.
