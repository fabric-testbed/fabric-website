question: Is there an interest in international partners participating - both from the hosting of internationally located nodes and international research teams?

Yes, we definitely are interested. While our currently available funding does not support deploying hardware outside the US, we will be working with other NSF programs and NSF partners to make this possible. 
We are interested in collaborating with international partners to deploy exchange points that will allow them to interconnect their facilities to FABRIC. We will share our software and hardware designs, so that experimental facilities like FABRIC can emerge in other countries and be federated with us to create a world-wide 'testbed-of-testbedsâ€™. 
We will be present at many international meetings where details of federation and connectivity are discussed so we can include them in our plans. 
If you are interested in collaborating internationally with us, please complete the Get Involved form at our website.
