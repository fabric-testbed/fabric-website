question: How is FABRIC different from GENI?
---
While FABRIC takes advantage of experience and approaches to building widely distributed testbeds collected from GENI, there are differences between FABRIC and GENI that drastically change and expand the types of experiments that can be performed:
+ FABRIC has a programmable core network infrastructure
+ FABRIC provides guaranteed quality of service by utilizing its own dedicated optical infrastructure or relying on dedicated L2 capacity wherever possible to create QoS-guaranteed connections.
+ FABRIC provides access to a variety of programmable PCI devices Network cards, GPUs, FPGAs
+ FABRIC supports highly accurate timestamping of events using GPS-based clocks.
+ FABRIC interconnects a large number of existing scientific, computational and experimental facilities
+ FABRIC experimenter network topologies can peer with production networks on-demand
+ FABRIC supports a broader range of data transfer speeds (10Gbs, 25Gbps, 100Gbps, 1000Gbps) along with the ability to compute on data at these line speeds within the network.
