question: Will FABRIC support Expansion Sites or BYOE? 
---
Yes, FABRIC will support expansion  sites (e.g. universities) that purchase their own FABRIC node (‘hank’) based on standard configurations that will be made available to the community, FABRIC team will also help facilitate connecting expansion sites to FABRIC topology either via Internet2 or with dedicated Layer2 or optical connectivity. We expect standard FABRIC Site BOMs to be available in the fall of 2020. Stay in touch by completing the Get Involved form.

FABRIC nodes also support a Bring Your Own Equipment (BYOE) model of contributions. Contributions of hardware to FABRIC can take a number of forms:
* PCI devices to be included in the available servers 
* Network switching equipment added to individual sites
* Discrete servers added to individual sites

BYOE contributions are subject to a number of constraints:
* Available rack space at individual sites
* Available power (core sites are limited to only 4kW total power budget)
* Available PCI slots in servers
* Available ports on FABRIC node dataplane and management switches

Contributed hardware will be linked into the FABRIC management plane and individual resources become provisionable via FABRIC CF. More details on BYOE support can be found in the FABRIC Node Design document.
