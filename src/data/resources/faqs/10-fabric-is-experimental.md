question: Will FABRIC always be experimental and no production?
---
FABRIC is a scientific instrument for supporting research in cyber-infrastructure. This implies that its primary use is for experiments in a variety of areas related to internet architectures, cyber-security, distributed protocols and applications. Many of these experiments may need to be long-running and carry production-like traffic in order to truly understand the tradeoffs in the system that is being experimented on. However, by virtue of being experiments, they canâ€™t be expected to provide production-grade reliability and robustness.

In order to support the widest possible variety of experiments spanning from blue-sky future Internet ideas to support for novel production science workflows, FABRIC will provide on-demand connectivity with production networks and facilities, to allow experimenters mix and match production and experimental resources in combinations that make sense for their experiments.
