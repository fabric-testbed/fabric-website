question: What specific types of PCI peripherals will FABRIC provide access to? 
---
Current FABRIC designs envision supporting Mellanox ConnectX family of dual-port network cards, NVIDIA GPUs (T4s and RTX6000s) and Xilinx Alveo family FPGAs.
FABRIC expects to provide limited support for GPU and FPGA application development workflows, instead partnering with other testbeds that offer similar devices so they can be used for developing the application codes that are then deployed in FABRIC.
