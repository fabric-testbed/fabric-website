  description: >
    Colosseum is owned and operated by the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) at Northeastern University. It is a PAWR affiliated testbed supported by NSF. Colosseum provides the fidelity of hardware channel emulators, the flexibility of cloud-based emulators, and the scale of network simulators. It can emulate wireless applications and signals (with granularity at the RF signal level) traversing space and reflecting off multiple objects and obstacles as they travel from transmitters to receivers. With over 65,000+ channels emulated at the same time, Colosseum can create virtual worlds modeling radios operating in open fields, downtown, shopping mall, or a desert, by generating more than 52 terabytes of data per second.
