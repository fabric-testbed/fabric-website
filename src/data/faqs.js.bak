    question: `Is there a "control link" that experiment nodes can talk to each other for control purposes? It's like SSH, but from the script running on a node, instead of an experimenter's laptop.`,
    answer: `
      Experiment slivers can (by default) be accessed via SSH over the public internet. FABRIC does not provide a FABRIC-defined “control channel” between slivers, but experimenters can use a sliver’s external-facing interfaces to implement a control channel over the public Internet.  Alternatively, experimenters can use a sliver’s internal-facing interfaces to implement a control channel over the experiment’s private dataplane.

      2.The metrics collection system sounds very powerful. I’m wondering, what technologies has FABRIC evaluated for this? FABRIC’s experience here could be instructive for operators of other multi-tenant research infrastructures. Will the metrics framework have any provision so experiments can capture network and node telemetry data? 

      The measurement system will collect a wide range of network, node, and other infrastructure telemetry data that will be available to experimenters. The FABRIC design is focused on specifying the functionality of the system components in an attempt to keep the design independent of the specific technologies used to implement FABRIC.

  {
    question: `How are you dealing with logging all of this information and how accessible it will be to researchers and/or support staff?`,
    answer: `
      Logging of component transactions/calls will occur over the message bus.  Logging of system events (e.g., metrics and packets) will occur to local storage on an aggregate or over the measurement bus to the remote storage.  By using pub/sub capabilities the data can be made available to authorized users (subscribers).
    `
  },
  {
    question: `Are measure data accessible immediately available for streaming analysis and modifying experiments right away?`,
    answer: `
      Yes but if capturing 100Gb of packets they'd be available at a later time due to the time to process. Measurement data will be sent over the measurement bus and be available via pub/sub style message channels.

  {
    question: `What about international aspects, as transoceanic networks are a focus for major science programs ?`,
    answer: `
      Currently FABRIC has a US-only footprint. We reach International networks through existing NREN connectivity (through peering points with ESnet, I2, and international exchange points). The IRNC NSF solicitation had a testbed section which encouraged applicants to work with FABRIC. Depending on awards, that might help address some International aspects of the major science programs.

  {
    question: `In terms of federated identity, what identity providers are supported?`,
    answer: `
      We will support any provider that is part of InCommon R&S (Research and Scholarship) federation. This includes the majority of US educational institutions. 
    `
  },
  {
    question: `How will FABRIC partner with other testbeds with a focus on joint system development in a persistent way, rather than point-experiments ?`,
    answer: `
      FABRIC is designed to foster persistent interoperation with a broad range of research infrastructure,including NRENs, regionals and campus partners. Persistent joint development can and has taken place at multiple levels from infrastructure interconnect to federated operation. An upcoming FABRIC workshop in Fall 2020 will focus on this topic.  FABRIC has also been explicitly tasked by NSF to support joint development of research infrastructure through multiple recent and upcoming solicitations such as NSF CC*, IRNC, etc.

    question: `For the 20 additional sites to be distributed among R&E communities, have the sites been identified already or is  FABRIC still open for new site proposals?`,
    answer: `
      Yes, see presentation for the planned sites.  Nonetheless, we are happy to talk to any campus or facilities with the interest of hosting a FABRIC node through their internal or grant funding.

  {
    question: `Will there be built-in (or allowing built-in with some policies or guidelines) security measures and monitoring processes? If so, will data collected through these processes be usable for research?`,
    answer: `
      There are rich opportunities to do so, and we expect the community to be engaged to envision and implement as much and diverse as FABRIC can support. This will be among the topics for our security roundtable.

  {
    question: `Is PacketGPS fully designed, or are there open design challenges?`,
    answer: `
      PacketGPS defines the use of PTP on servers, HW timestamping on NIC cards, and the deployment of GPS based timeservers in FABRIC racks.  Open design challenges include characterization of the overall accuracy and jitter of the implemented timestamps.  Synchronization accuracy across sites, and data reduction of PacketGPS measurements for long term recording are also being explored.

  {
    question: `FABRIC is more aligned with OSCARS for testbed integration, probably, because of the ESNET already deployed infrastructure. For testbeds using OFELIA (for instance, testbeds connected to FED4FIRE) interested in connecting to FABRIC, what would be the effort to connect? What would be the technical & conceptual challenges? `,
    answer: `
      FABRIC is implemented on top of the ESnet6 optical infrastructure. Consequently, it will have its own network substrate, and its integration methodology will not be limited to OSCARS. As detailed in the FABRIC design documents, FABRIC can federate and/or integrate with collaborating testbed infrastructure at multiple levels, from as simple as coordinated network peering to automated provisioning via respective APIs.

  {
    question: `Will operational data be available? Can we check on the status of network devices during our experiments and correlate the network health with anomalies we may see in our experiments (e.g. a system with a bad interface card)?`,
    answer: `
      Yes, although we are still determining specifics. We welcome suggestions of specific data needs for experimenters and we will provide as much data as the infrastructure can support. Starting mid-summer 2020, We plan on hosting a series of roundtables and/or workshops specifically to gather input around the issues (technology, resource, and policy) of data, measurement, storage, and access.

  {
    question: `Do you imagine FABRIC being able to support accounting on bits in packet headers?   For high-energy physics, we are exploring adding labels into our packet  to allow us to understand our traffic, its "owner" and purpose at anywhere in the network.`,
    answer: `
      Experimenters can access packets using DPDK, and optionally NPU / FPGA based packet editors.  They can implement any form of accounting that is novel.  This exploration is very much the mission driver for a testbed like FABRIC.

  {
    question: `Please comment on some of the security posture of the Control Framework and the testbed itself.`,
    answer: `
      FABRIC will be constructed with off-the-shelf components and will employ best-of-breed security technologies. We plan on a robust security framework following the guidelines in the NIST 800-53 as much as feasible. Prior to production and at annual intervals, we will conduct an infrastructure audit under the guidelines of the NIST 800-30, as well as conduct Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST and DAST) throughout the development lifecycle as part of our SDLC.

    question: `Since the current emerging technologies are 200G servers and interfaces and switches, 400G switches, and 400 - 800G optical platforms, how do we get those current and emerging technologies integrated into the concept of FABRIC. [What was presented framed those as future elements but 100G technologies have been mature in the WAN since 2013, and in servers since around 2015-16.]`,
    answer: `
      We strive to create an environment that combines stability, speed and scale with the ability to host a number of concurrent experiments. Our optical layer is capable of 100Gbps and the current design centers on supporting those speeds. As we deploy the supercore portion of the testbed we will also include NICs with speeds of 200G and 400G in a number of locations. Our network switches will have the ability to support speeds of 200G or above. 
    `
  },
  {
    question: `Will there be some FABRIC-owned racks on the edges for prototype experimentations ?`,
    answer: `
      The current planned FABRIC footprint includes 29 locations, most of which are on university campuses and in labs. We are also working with other testbeds to ensure some commonality of hardware, which will enable prototyping portions of FABRIC experiments in other facilities. 
    `
  },
  {
    question: `Will FABRIC provide FPGA hardware?`,
    answer: `
      Yes, FABRIC nodes have FPGAs that can be reserved for use in experiments. There will be instructions for the programming and execution workflow.  If researchers have special FPGAs that they’d like to be “plugged into” FABRIC for experiments, FABRIC will discuss it on a case-by-case basis to install the researcher-provided hardware into FABRIC as a BYOE (Bring Your Own Equipment). 
    `
  },
  {
    question: `How will resources be allocated, especially in the joint systems development context, where some long-term allocations will be required?`,
    answer: `
      When FABRIC enters production it will have an AUP and an allocation policy that supports allocating resources to long-running experiments.  
    `
  },
  {
    question: `Has the FABRIC measurement team considered how measurement systems will be used for testbed operational issues vs. experimental issues?`,
    answer: `
      The measurement infrastructure will collect data useful to experimenters and/or operators.  FABRIC operators are expected to leverage measurement data to improve operations and to identify experimental issues.  Making data available to users will hopefully encourage new (ML) approaches that can identify experimenter or operational issues. 
    `
  },
  {
    question: `When accessing cloud resources with data intensive applications, will the issue of costs of storage and especially data flows out of the cloud be mitigated, or solved ?`,
    answer: `
      We’re still considering how to incorporate cloud storage. At this time, experimenters are responsible for the costs of cloud workflows and storage but that could change in the future.
    `
  },
  {
    question: `It looks that the networking community has developed multiple testbeds before, and many components (both design and implementation) may (or should) be reusable. Is there a reusability plan?`,
    answer: `
      We are actively working with many other active testbeds for federated uses.  While FABRIC’s software will maximize use of open source software, the FABRIC design does not currently have reused components from other past testbeds, but does leverage experiences learned from past testbeds, and uses some of the open source software used in past testbeds.

  },
  {
    question: `Storage Speed (Read / Write) be at line-rate?`,
    answer: `
      Incoming line speeds are expected to be 10, 25, and 100 Gbps, and packets can be written to RAM, NVMe, or Disk storage.  Only RAM storage can support all line-rates, while NVMe storage can be used for the slower line rates.
    `
  },
  {
    question: `If the client software stack is oriented towards ongoing real-time interactions and some operational decisions in support of science programs, would the FABRIC software be able to interact and participate in decision-support, or actual (joint) decisions ?`,
    answer: `
      There are multiple ways in which applications can drive FABRIC infrastructure dynamically. The first way is for the application to directly invoke FABRIC provisioning APIs and actively manage the resource topology and configuration. The second way is for a community that is interested in doing this to construct their own orchestrator that operates as part of the FABRIC Control Framework. The current design of the control framework supports the deployment of multiple orchestrators potentially speaking different user-facing APIs, relying on their own business/decision support logic and even using their own information models.

  {
    question: `Will there be any agreements (like a CRADA) provided for international participant.s My interest is in establishing a hank node in South Africa and to participate on NSF resources usually something like a CRADA agreement is required.`,
    answer: `
      This is a Federal grant for conducting open science experiments, so there are no contracts needed for participants to join us! We welcome participation from International nodes and researchers and will work with partners to ensure their participation is successful. We will have Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with partner sites to ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear with regard to operating and maintaining the nodes.

  {
    question: `Is there a plan for an "official" process by which experimenters can contribute their code (once it is hardened and deemed useful), have it vetted, and make it available to others as part of the FABRIC software? (Example: a more sophisticated control channel for experiments.)`,
    answer: `
      We are currently working out a desired process (e.g., contributing code to github or containers to dockerhub), but we have no intention of preventing the community from developing other processes. Each initial Science Design Driver is required to identify, harden, and share their software and/or experimental setup with all FABRIC users. We’d ask the same of other experimenters as we stand up FABRIC for use.
    `
  },
  {
    question: `With BYOE allowing experimenters to deploy their own switches, would it be possible to access lower layers of the network (i.e., wavelengths or dark fiber)?`,
    answer: `
      The current FABRIC design includes a limited set of dark fiber segments in a small number of geographic locations, separate from the main FABRIC infrastructure. Within the main footprint, we will allow measurements of the underlying optical layer but will not support programmability on it or access to dark fiber.

    question: `Can you provide a bit more information about packet capture capabilities? Are there any privacy considerations related to packet capture? What traffic will experimenters be able to see/analyze? All traffic flowing through a physical FABRIC node? Or only traffic generated by other slices/nodes "owned" by the same experimenter? What are the constraints?`,
    answer: `
      We are setting up a working group on data to help answer some of these data access questions.  A guiding principle will be to make as much data public as possible.

  {
    question: `How much buffer is available for the switches, and how fast would the buffer be? (Do users have control over that?)`,
    answer: `
      One of the primary services FABRIC offers is on-demand L2 with minimal elasticity/buffering to avoid cross-experiment influence. By constructing virtual switches out of available NICs experimenters will have control over buffering and queuing policies (depending on the type of NIC used).

  },
  {
    question: `If 50 undergrads each allocate a 3-node topology, are you going to run out of resources?`,
    answer: `
      FABRIC experiments will be based on virtualized components with either best effort or guaranteed resources. It is not possible to support such a large number of student experiments with high levels of resource guarantees; though it is possible that they can be supported with best effort or scaled down resources for their learning purposes. FABRIC will have allocation policies that help decide the priorities for accessing the infrastructure.There will be a  subset of links that support absolute guaranteed bandwidth for those that choose to reserve with such guarantees.  For students in a class, to achieve the learning objectives with limited overall capacity, it’s not likely that the assignments ask for such guarantees.  Those will be prioritized for research needs.]
