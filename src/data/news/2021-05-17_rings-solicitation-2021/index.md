The <a href="https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resilient & Intelligent NextG Systems (RINGS)</a> program seeks to accelerate research in areas that will potentially have significant impact on emerging Next Generation (NextG) wireless and mobile communication, networking, sensing, and computing systems, along with global-scale services, with a focus on greatly improving the resiliency of such networked systems among other performance metrics. The solicitation for RINGS (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21581/nsf21581.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF 21-581</a>) encourages proposals to evaluate or demonstrate their innovations using FABRIC.

FABRIC is a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF</a>-funded nationwide next-generation network testbed comprising novel extensible network elements equipped with compute and storage capabilities located throughout the network, interconnected by high-speed dedicated optical links.

Proposals for the RINGS solicitation are due July 29, 2021. NSF will be hosting an informational <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=302634&org=NSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar</a> about RINGS on May 27, 2021, where attendees can learn more about proposal requirements and expectations.
