The FABRIC team is proud to share its [newest testbed release](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/forums/topic/fabric-is-now-open-with-even-more-sites-and-features/). The team has added many new production sites and has introduced the FABlib library; both of which increase the capabilities and usability of the testbed.

The FABRIC community is cordially invited to participate in an upcoming FABRIC tutorial webinar, hosted by Paul Ruth. The purpose of this webinar is to introduce incoming and existing beta users to the new features and onboard new teams to the testbed. The FABlib library is significantly different from the original FABRIC API and this webinar will be valuable to both new and experienced users. During this webinar, Ruth will present new features and walkthrough several FABlib example experiments.

New users will be given the opportunity to create accounts, although the team will ask any new users to create an account before the start of the webinar. FABRIC team members will be available to help any users who have trouble creating accounts.

Tutorial dates include:

<ul>
  <li>May 12</li>
  <li>June 9</li>
  <li>July 14</li>
  <li>August 11</li>
</ul>

All webinars will take place from <b>12 - 2 PM ET</b>, and space will be limited. Please indicate all dates that you are available on the form when you register, and the team will be in touch with your confirmed webinar date.
