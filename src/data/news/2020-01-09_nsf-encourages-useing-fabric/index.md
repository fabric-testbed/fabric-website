The [NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748) program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. The most recent solicitation for CC* ([NSF 20-507](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20507/nsf20507.htm)) encourages proposals to include performing experimental deployment, protocol testing, and evaluation using FABRIC.  

FABRIC is a [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/)-funded nationwide next-generation network testbed comprising novel extensible network elements equipped with compute and storage capabilities located throughout the network, interconnected by high-speed dedicated optical links. 

According to the NSF proposal, FABRICâ€™s programmability combined with high-fidelity measurement capabilities provides a compelling research infrastructure that supports applied network research. Using such a testbed, for example, a researcher could conduct edge-core-cloud evaluations. 

Proposals for the CC* solicitation are due January 21, 2020. Reach out to us at [info@fabric-testbed.net](info@fabric-testbed.net) to discuss the details of our deployment plans and request an LoC.
