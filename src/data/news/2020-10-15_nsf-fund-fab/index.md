The FABRIC team submitted a proposal to the 2020 NSF International Research and Education Network Connections (IRNC) program to expand FABRIC globally. We're thrilled to announce that NSF is funding FAB (FABRIC Across Borders), a 3-year project to place FABRIC nodes at 4 International locations: University of Tokyo (partner Aki Nakao), University of Amsterdam (partner Cees de Laat), University of Bristol (partner Dimitra Simeonidou), and Geneva (partner CERN). The project will officially kick off in January 2021.

The science use cases of FAB (which build upon and complement the science drivers in FABRIC) and the associated early experimenters are:

<ul>
  <li>High Energy Physics: High Luminosity LHC (co-PI Rob Gardner, University of Chicago)</li>
  <li>Astronomy & Cosmology: LSST (William O'Mullane and Leanne Guy) and CMB-S4 (Julian Borrill and John Carlstrom)</li>
  <li>Smart & Connected Communities (Dimitra Simeonidou, Bristol Smart Internet Lab & Charlie Catlett, SAGE)</li>
  <li>Weather Science (Ben Kirtman, University of Miami)</li>
  <li>Networking: Censorship Evasion (Richard Brooks, Clemson), SDX Policy Negotiation (Ken Calvert, University of Kentucky), SDN and P4 (South Korea R&E Network KISTI)</li>
  <li>Private 5G (Nakao Lab, Tokyo)</li>
</ul>
